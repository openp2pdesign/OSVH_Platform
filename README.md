# Platform for the Open School of Village Hosts - Erasmus+ VET project

A platform, thanks to its ability of onboarding, matching, networking and supporting distributed actors, can have an important role in supporting the European (and maybe also global!) Village Hosts community in this direction. Furthermore, such a tool is not only useful for sharing knowledge, organise events and initiatives and supporting peer-to-peer learning dynamics, but also for gaining a picture of the community as a whole, with the connections and interactions among all the members. Mapping all the distributed actors that are active in rural social innovation can both reinforce the community and gather data about it: providing statistics about Village Hosts and their impact, the OSVH platform can generate data that can be further adopted in order to promote the importance of Village Hosts to policy makers, institutions at all levels, companies, associations and citizens.
